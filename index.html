  </p>
  <p>I am a self-taught web developer and a part-time IT Technician.
    During high school, I had taken a technical class that had taught me all of the
    basics of software and hardware troubleshooting. From here I stated to take a college
    class on C++, this has allowed me to understand the basics of programming and further pushed me to freelance.</p>
